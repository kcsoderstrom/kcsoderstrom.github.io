A shirt I made a few months ago!

Took apart an old polyester shirt I had loved but that pilled and turned stinky within a few wears; used that to make the pattern. Made of a long-fiber hemp-linen-cotton blend, so no pilling, and not clinging to any summer microbes.

The new fabric is a bit looser than the old one - this is why you can't make muslins with knits really - so it hangs off the shoulders a bit. Still, it's my first homemade garment I have been comfortable wearing in public.
