title: woven basket

You remember that basketweaving I was 80% done with? Finished it. 🙂

Well~ sort of. You can see some loose weavers I didn't tuck, but the spokes that I tucked after doing the "ordinary border" technique on the top tended to slip out after I trimmed them, so I'm a little nervous to do more. Plus it doesn't make it any less functional.

I couldn't find a basket that had the right dimensions to put on the back of our toilet and that I didn't hate the look of. Probably could have if I spent more time or were willing to spend more money on a ready-made product. But I preferred to learn how to do basketweaving for less money.

I'm sure it looks like a toddler made it to anyone who knows what they're doing. The base isn't flat; the weaver ends aren't tucked; sometimes I did my twining in the wrong direction, disrupting the pattern; the border is sloppy and loose and has spokes tucked in random places sometimes because they slipped out of where they were supposed to go. But I have ideas about how to do it better next time, and I know a little bit more now than I did when I started. 🙂 AND it fits the back of the toilet perfectly. (Although I had to add some felt pads to make sure it didn't slip at an inconvenient time.)
