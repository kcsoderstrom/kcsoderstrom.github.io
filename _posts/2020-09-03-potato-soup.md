My favorite simple potato soup recipe:

1. Have your partner harvest his own potatoes from the garden. He is very busy and not motivated by hunger, so this will take a long time.
2. Peel the potatoes and add them to your pressure cooker, along with 2 leeks, sliced, plenty of liquid smoke, and just enough soy milk - you can always add more.
3. You remember that mushroom bouillon you got ages ago, that you only used once because it tasted more salty than flavorful? You remember how you decided not to throw it away and promised yourself you would use it? You remember how your partner always wants more salt added to his food? Definitely use it instead of your usual bouillon. Don't worry about reading the directions - you know how much bouillon you should use, you absolute legend.
4. Pressure cook on low for 15 minutes, then blend with an immersion blender.
5. It's done! Serve it. No wait. Taste it first. Oh no. That is much too salty. Give your partner a sample to confirm - yes, much too salty. He won't eat it.
6. You have this under control. Take out half the soup and set aside; dilute what's left with half a carton of soy milk. Bland, bland soy milk. Plus you know how whenever you make a broccoli soup, it's way too bland? Add an entire head of broccoli, stalk and all. Plus all the kale in the freezer. Yeah, that will mellow this out. Pressure cook on low for 0 minutes and blend again.
7. How is this possible. It still just tastes like salt. Take half of it out again. Add an entire block of tofu. And another head of broccoli. Plus like 3 cups of water. Pressure cook for 0 minutes and blend again.
8. I don't know how they fit so much sodium into that bouillon, but this is still pretty salty. Take it to your partner for a taste, just in case, since he likes food saltier than you do. Alright, he's ok with it. Give him a giant bowl because he will have to eat many giant bowls to get through this before it spoils. At least it's nutritious.
There you have it! An easy recipe for a surprisingly low-carb potato-leek-mushroom-tofu-broccoli-kale soup that your quarantinemates will love!
