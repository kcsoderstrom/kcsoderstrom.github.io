How to paint a mediocre painting with no art skills:

1. Decide on watercolor, because every kid does watercolor, so it must be easy.
2. Try to paint a watercolor. Make a big mess. Feel defeated.
3. Take a break. Start a career in software. Study programming on the job for several years.
4. Watch countless watercolor tutorial videos. Try them and and make a big mess. Feel defeated.
5. Write some software to accept reference photos and auto-generate much more detailed steps than the ones you see in the tutorials.
6. Follow the instructions. Don't make a big mess. Don't feel defeated.

It isn't a masterpiece but I'll take it. ðŸ˜Š
