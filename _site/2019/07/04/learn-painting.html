    <p>How to paint a mediocre painting with no art skills:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decide on watercolor, because every kid does watercolor, so it must be easy.</li>
  <li>Try to paint a watercolor. Make a big mess. Feel defeated.</li>
  <li>Take a break. Start a career in software. Study programming on the job for several years.</li>
  <li>Watch countless watercolor tutorial videos. Try them and and make a big mess. Feel defeated.</li>
  <li>Write some software to accept reference photos and auto-generate much more detailed steps than the ones you see in the tutorials.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions. Donâ€™t make a big mess. Donâ€™t feel defeated.</li>
</ol>

<p>It isnâ€™t a masterpiece but Iâ€™ll take it. ðŸ˜Š</p>
