<p>Finally got around to stuffing a pillow that has been sitting around for ages!</p>

<p>I had stumbled upon the drawing in Mr. S’s sketchbook one day, and had a vision of it as a pillow, black on a neutral light-skin-like tone, harsh contrast.</p>

<p>My partner was kind enough to redraw his sketch on a larger scale for me.</p>

<p>He was going for a “women laughing with salad” vibe.</p>

<p>As much as I like the embroidered part, I’m not in love with how the rest turned out. But I promised myself that I would let the project guide me, instead of being too prescriptive and forcing it to drag on forever. I can always make a better pillow tomorrow. And I’m certainly not mad about this one. 🙂</p>

<p>And just look at those enclosed seams! Cleanest closure I have ever done.</p>
